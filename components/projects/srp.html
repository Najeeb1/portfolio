            <h2>Project Overview</h2>
            <p>This project focuses on <strong>Hierarchical Time Series Forecasting</strong>, a crucial task in various fields such as sales monitoring, electricity consumption, and traffic management. Traditional forecasting models often deal with deterministic predictions, but uncertainty quantification is needed to provide more reliable insights. The current state-of-the-art model, <strong>Hier-E2E</strong>, uses a multivariate forecaster for generating probabilistic forecasts, with reconciliation done through a projection step to maintain coherence across hierarchical variables. We propose a novel approach called <strong>HiT</strong> that eliminates the projection step for reconciliation, thus simplifying the model while preserving forecast accuracy. The HiT model is trained by feeding only the bottom-level time series to the <strong>DeepVAR</strong> model, and higher-level forecasts are obtained by summing the predictions from the relevant bottom levels. A new loss function is introduced to inherently handle hierarchical constraints, improving the overall forecast quality.</p>

            <h2>Technical Implementation</h2>
            <p>The HiT model utilizes <strong>DeepVAR</strong> to forecast the bottom-level time series data, where higher-level forecasts are generated by summing the forecasts from appropriate lower levels. This approach eliminates the need for the projection-based reconciliation in traditional models like <strong>Hier-E2E</strong>. To train the HiT model, we introduced a new loss function that inherently handles the hierarchical nature of the time series data. The model is evaluated on three real-world datasets, with performance compared to baseline models based on <strong>CRPS (Continuous Ranked Probability Score)</strong>.
